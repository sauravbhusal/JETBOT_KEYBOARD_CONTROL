I am trying to control the jetbot using pygame so this is our trial code:

the code that detect the keypress is done.
now it's time to set the pressed key function and when the specific key is pressed, we need to assign the pressed key value to a variable that will preform specific operation in jetbot.
this file will be updated timely until the code is completed. stay tuned!!!
